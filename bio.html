        <p>I was born in Taegu, South Korea. When I was thirteen, my family and I moved to Seoul, where I graduated from high school and college. Then, I came to the United States as an international student and earned an MA and a PhD in English.  I am currently an associate professor of English at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, TN.</p>

        <p>From <i>To Kill a Tiger</i> (p. 165):</p>

        <p>Running to meet Father on the train platform in Seoul Station, I saw the face that his children had always loved. Now, I know that it was love that my family was unable to express except in the form of quarrels governing our house. It was love in a dust storm. Blinded by the wind, we each made the mistake of believing the others were throwing dirt at us, and picked up the same dirt to hurt each other in return.</p>
